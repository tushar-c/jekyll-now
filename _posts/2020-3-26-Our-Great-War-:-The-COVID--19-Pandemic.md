## (A Personal) Prologue

This post is a little special. One of the main reasons is that I'm taking to writing after a year, as I managed to burn myself out completely in the past six months.

I am glad for people who have taken the time out to read and review what I have to say on things I like. That was a big part of what has kept me writing. 

The tone of this post, unlike those in the past, is going to be realistic, which is code for informal. I intend to keep the mood light and upbeat with pictures, animated GIFs while talking about a very serious topic that is the cause of these uncertain times. 

Now, a lot of the COVID-19 posts tend to live on two extremes. They either become too technical too quickly, or merely enlist a bunch of statistics without any explanation and start to resemble popular culture magazine articles.

I've tried to maintain a balance. The aim is to boil things down to their simplest forms while not being wrong, and be able to explain the relevant science to anyone, anywhere, regardless of their background.

One point worth mentioning before we begin is that the material on this subject is constantly changing and being updated, more rapidly than any single one of us can keep up. That is why you should make sure to keep as many sources of information open to you as possible. 

One last thing. The one thing we keep in our minds at all times is:

**THERE IS PASSIONATE HATE FOR COMPLEX WORDS AND TECHNICAL JARGON IN THIS BLOG!**

With all that out of the way, sit back, relax, put on your thinking cap and let's begin!


## An Introduction: So What Is The Coronavirus Really?

To understand the enemy in all its gory depth, we first have to get an image of what a virus actually is. Viruses are a huge topic and have a whole academic field in their own right. However, we only need a very minute portion of that field here.

It might come as a surprise to you that in the world of biology, viruses are considered to be neither alive nor dead! We'll see very shortly why that is the case.
