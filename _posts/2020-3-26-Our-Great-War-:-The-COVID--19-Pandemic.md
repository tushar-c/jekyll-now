## (A Personal) Prologue

This post is a little special. One of the main reasons is that I'm taking to writing after a year, as I managed to burn myself out completely in the past six months.

I am glad for people who have taken the time out to read and review what I have to say on things I like. That was a big part of what has kept me writing. 

##  Simple Is The New Sexy: Understanding This Complex Beast

The tone of this post unlike those in the past, is going to be realistic, which is code for informal. I intend to keep the mood light and upbeat with comic images and GIFs while talking about a very serious topic that is the cause of these uncertain times. 

Now, a lot of the COVID-19 posts tend to live on two extremes. They either become too technical too quickly, or merely enlist a bunch of statistics without any explanation, jump to conclusions and start resembling popular culture magazine articles.

I've tried to maintain a balance by trying to boil things down to their simplest forms while not being wrong. The approach to learning here is 'need-based' rather than sequential. We will talk about ideas only when they are needed and not try to cover everything first and then proceed with the applications, that's supremely inefficient.

### The aim is to be able to explain the relevant science to anyone, anywhere, regardless of their background.

One point worth mentioning before we begin is that the material on this subject is constantly changing and being updated, more rapidly than any single one of us can keep up. That is why you should make sure to keep as many sources of information open to you as possible. 

The one core belief around which everything else here exists is that:

**THERE IS NO POINT IN MAKING THINGS COMPLEX IN THE PURSUIT OF SOUNDING IMPRESSIVE.**

With all that out of the way, let's get to business. So sit back, relax, put your thinking cap on and let's begin!


## An Introduction: So What Is The Coronavirus Really? Hold On, What Exactly Is A Virus Though?

**"Everyone wants to party but nobody wants to do the dishes."**

Before we can get to the interesting stuff about the Coronavirus and COVID-19, the associated disease, it's a good idea to get a relatively good grip of the basics. Before we get to the 'Corona' bit, we will talk a little about the 'Virus' bit.

To understand the enemy in all its gory depth, we first have to get an image in our minds of what a virus actually is. Viruses are a huge topic, there are over 5,000 species of viruses and they have a whole academic field in their own right, that's Virology. 

But don't worry, we won't spend all day here! We only need a 2-minute blitz worth of it.

It might come as a surprise to you that, in spite of being the most populous type of biological entity, viruses are considered to be neither alive nor dead! This is because viruses by themselves cannot replicate ( *grow* ), nor can they derive their own energy ( *eat food* ). 

To make things clear, the larger consensus among the scientific community is to not treat viruses as living organisms, though their status has historically always been a matter of debate. This might seem confusing (It is).

Viruses rely on hosts for their growth and nourishment. Once they breach into a host cell, that is when they exhibit all the habits you would expect from living beings: 

**A. They can create more copies of themselves (this is really all there is to biology, basically :) )**

**B. Package them for redistribution (send the children to work), as well as derive energy from the host to keep replicating ( see the point? ).** 

They use the host's resources to perform their everyday tasks, thereby weakening the host (if this goes on too much for too long, the host falls sick. You might see where this is going).

It might have probably occured to you that viruses are like parasites in nature, you wouldn't be wrong!

The basic parts of a virus (when the  virus is not busy infecting a cell, roaming about in the world, it is called a *virion*, an unemployed virus) are simple to understand. 

### There's a very tiny bit of technical terms coming up. Again, if you do not know what they mean, please don't let that discourage you. We'll take apart each one of them and you'll see that just like most things in life, they aren't that complex after all.

With that being said, a cartoon structure is down here.

![Virus Diagram]({{site.baseurl}}/images/virus.png)

Technically, this picture is that of an 'Animal Virus', the kind of virus that affects you and me. A more mainstream picture will make an appearance further down. 

As you can see, there's really only three real parts:

1. The DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) / RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) - **The Mastermind**

2. The Protein Coat - **The Muscle**

3. The Envelope - **The Trickster**

**1. The DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) / RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)  of the Virus**

See that dark thread in the middle? You would not be very far from the truth if you said that threads like this one are the reason you're forced to sit in your home right now. That's the genetic material of the virus.

That material, which is either DNA or RNA (the distinction is **NOT** important to us right now), is the 'brain' of the virus and decides how the virus will function, that is, how will it create more copies, use energy, and infect the host. 

The name of the game is to synthesize (create) proteins. These proteins are what let the virus do it's job. More copies of the virus means more quantity of that protein, more protein in this case means more infection.

### Hang in there, we're almost done with the basics of a virus!


**2. The Protein Coat**

That necklace made up of beads (they are called 'capsomers' in technical jargon. capsomers are basically capsules filled with protein) is the protein coat. What does that do? Well, it got hired by our beloved management at Virus Incorporated for three main reasons:

**A. The coat protects the DNA / RNA of the virus. Think of it as the skull that protects the brain.**


**B. It has slots that allow the virus to latch on to a host.**


**C. It contains chemicals (proteins) that let the virion (remember the unemployed virus?) sneak into the host (in technical jargon: these proteins help the virion penetrate into the host's cell membrane. But that's boring.)**


**3. The Envelope**

This outline, the envelope, contains materials (called glycoproteins, a special kind of protein. The specifics are not important to us right now) from the virus as well as the host (if the virus has come in contact with a host).

These materials give the virus the ability to evade the immune system of the host. The immune system works on memory. It can fend off pathogens (disease causing microorganisms) it has seen before. 

By having materials from the immune system of the host, the virus is able to evade the immune system of the host (this is much like playing a reverse card in UNO).  

Oh and about that mainstream virus image? Here it is, this is a type of virus that's called a *Bacteriophage*. This means that it is a virus that specifically infects bacteria. Impressive in it's own right, but not of much use to us right now.

### We're done with the basics of viruses! Now, onto the interesting questions!
