## (A Personal) Prologue

This post is a little special. One of the main reasons is that I'm taking to writing after a year, as I managed to burn myself out completely in the past 6 months! I am glad for all the people who have taken the time out to read and review what I have to say on things I like, that was a big part of what has kept me writing. 

This is the first time we have a post on an ongoing issue and not just something that's abstract, but something very real and something that can affect us all, either directly or indirectly. 

This is why the tone of this post, unlike those in the past, is going to be realistic, which is code for informal.

A lot of the COVID-19 posts tend to live on two extremes. They either become too technical too quickly, or they start to resemble popular culture magazine articles. 

I've tried to maintain a balance. The aim is to boil things down to their simplest forms while not being wrong, and be able to explain the relevant science to anyone, anywhere, regardless of their background.

One last thing that should be mentioned before we begin is that the material on this subject is constantly changing and being updated, more rapidly than any single one of us can keep up. That is why you should make sure to keep as many sources of information open to you as possible. 

After all this time, one thing that hasn't changed is that:

**THERE IS STILL PASSIONATE HATE FOR COMPLEX WORDS AND TECHNICAL JARGON IN THIS BLOG!**

With that out of the way, let's begin!
