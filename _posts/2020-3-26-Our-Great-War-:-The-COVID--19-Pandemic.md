## (A Personal) Prologue

This post is a little special. One of the main reasons is that I'm taking to writing after a year, as I managed to burn myself out completely in the past 6 months! I am glad for all the people who have taken the time out to read and review what I have to say on things I like, that was a big part of what has kept me going. 

This is the first time I'm ever writing about an ongoing issue and not just something that's abstract, but something very real and something that can affect both you and me, either directly or indirectly. 

One last thing that should be mentioned before we begin is that the material on this subject is constantly changing and being updated, more rapidly than any single one of us can keep up. This is why you should make sure to keep as many sources of information open to you as possible. 

Also, most COVID-19 posts tend to live on two extremes. They either become too technical too quickly, or they start to resemble popular culture magazine articles. I've tried to maintain a balance. The aim is to boil things down to their simplest forms while not being wrong.


**I STILL PASSIONATELY HATE COMPLEX WORDS AND TECHNICAL JARGON!**

With that out of the way, let's begin!
