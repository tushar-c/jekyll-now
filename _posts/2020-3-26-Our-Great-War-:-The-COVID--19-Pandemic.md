## (A Personal) Prologue

This post is a little special. One of the main reasons is that I'm taking to writing after a year, as I managed to burn myself out completely in the past six months.

I am glad for people who have taken the time out to read and review what I have to say on things I like. That was a big part of what has kept me writing. 

##  Simple Is The New Sexy: Understanding This Complex Beast

The tone of this post unlike those in the past, is going to be realistic, which is code for informal. I intend to keep the mood light and upbeat with comic images and GIFs while talking about a very serious topic that is the cause of these uncertain times. 

Now, a lot of the COVID-19 posts tend to live on two extremes. They either become too technical too quickly, or merely enlist a bunch of statistics without any explanation, jump to conclusions and start resembling popular culture magazine articles.

I've tried to maintain a balance. The aim is to boil things down to their simplest forms while not being wrong, and be able to explain the relevant science to anyone, anywhere, regardless of their background.

One point worth mentioning before we begin is that the material on this subject is constantly changing and being updated, more rapidly than any single one of us can keep up. That is why you should make sure to keep as many sources of information open to you as possible. 

The one core belief of this blog that hasn't changed is:

**THERE IS NO POINT IN MAKING THINGS COMPLEX IN THE PURSUIT OF SOUNDING IMPRESSIVE.**

With all that out of the way, sit back, relax, put on your thinking cap and let's begin!


## An Introduction: So What Is The Coronavirus Really?

**"Everyone wants to party, but nobody wants to do the dishes."**

Before we can get to the interesting stuff about the Coronavirus and COVID-19, the associated disease, it's a good idea get a relatively good grip of the basics. Before we get to the 'Corona' bit, we will talk a little about the 'Virus' bit.

To understand the enemy in all its gory depth, we first have to get an image in our minds of what a virus actually is. Viruses are a huge topic and have a whole academic field in their own right. 

But don't worry, we won't spend all day here! We only need a 60-second blitz worth of it.

It might come as a surprise to you that, in spite of being the most populous type of biological entity, viruses are considered to be neither alive nor dead! This is because viruses by themselves cannot replicate (*read: grow*), nor can they derive their own energy (*read: food*). 

However, once they breach into a host cell, that is when they exhibit all these properties. They can create more copies of themselves and package them for redistribution, also derive energy from the host to keep replicating. 

They use the host's resources to perform their everyday tasks, thereby weakening the host (if this goes on too much for too long, the host falls sick. You might see where this is going).

It might have probably occured to you that viruses are like parasites in nature, you wouldn't be wrong!

To make things clear, the larger consensus among the scientific community is to not treat viruses as living organisms. This might seem confusing (It is).

The basic components of a virus (when the individual virus particle is outside a cell, roaming about in the world, it is called a *virion*, an unemployed virus) are simple to understand. 

A cartoon structure is down here.

**There's a very tiny bit of technical terms coming up. Again, if you do not know what they mean, please don't let that discourage you. We'll take apart each of them and you'll see they aren't that complex after all!**

Technically, this picture is that of an 'Animal Virus', the kind of virus that affects you and me. There very many (over 5,000) species of viruses. Another picture that will be shown below might be more mainstream, but let's keep that aside for now.

As you can see, there's really only three real parts:

1. The DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) / RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)  of the Virus
2. The Protein Coat
3. The Envelope

The DNA is the 'brain' of the virus and decides how and what the virus will do. There are viruses that have RNA  instead. The difference is not important to us right now.
