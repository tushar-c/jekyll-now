![Classification]({{site.baseurl}}/images/SheepClass.jpg)

In the last post we talked about Linear Regression, which is a technique of predicting numerical (more precisely, continuous) values given an input. Now, even though the name of the technique is Logistic Regression, it involves classification rather than regression. Classification, as the name suggests, involves placing a given input into of $$1 of N$$ classes. When $$N = 2$$, we call it binary classification. Generally, for $$N > 3$$, we call the scenario multiclass classification.
