## Introduction
In this post we are going to talk about a learning technique that is, at least at the very minimum, based on the structure of a brain. The title of the blog post summarizes this approach. While at first sight it might seem that with the terminology of *neurons* and *neuronal weights* we are modelling something like the brain, it reality, ANNs (Artificial Neural Networks) are really just complex non-linear (possibly linear) pattern recognition architectures. 


## A Few Points To Keep In Mind
Before we begin describing the architecture and how it works, it is important to keep in mind *what the algorithms are really doing*. It is very easy to get hung up into the machinery involved and lose sight of the *big picture*.
