## (A Personal) Prologue

This post is a little special. One of the main reasons is that I'm taking to writing after a year, as I managed to burn myself out completely in the past six months.

I am glad for people who take the time out to read and review what I have to say on things I like. People keep me pursuing this hobby.

## Simple Is The New Sexy: Our Approach To Understanding

A lot of the COVID-19 posts tend to live on two extremes. They either become too technical too quickly, or merely enlist a bunch of statistics without any explanation, jump to conclusions and start resembling popular culture magazine articles.

I've tried to maintain a balance by boiling things down to their simplest forms while not being wrong. 

### The aim is to be able to explain the relevant science to anyone, anywhere, regardless of their background.

These are uncertain times, and they require carefully worded and delicately handled explanations. There is an inherent trade-off between explaining the core of things and covering too much.

That's why this topic has been broken down into a series of posts. I've decided to stop at three. This is the first.

In the first post, we want to set the stage with the Biology basics so that we're able to answer two major questions about this pandemic. They are: 

### 1. What Is The Coronavirus ?

### 2. How Is It Spreading So Quickly ?

Later, we'll ask the really interesting questions related to the Coronavirus and COVID-19. We'll also look at the more *human* aspect of things and talk about what lies ahead in the future for humanity and whether pandemics like this one will become a part of our lives (?!?).  

## The biggest advantage of true understanding is that we'll be able to get all the virology memes!

### The tone of every post in this series, unlike those in the past, is going to be realistic, which is code for informal. I intend to keep the mood light and upbeat while talking about a very serious topic that is at the heart of these uncertain times. 

One point worth mentioning before we begin is that the material on this subject is constantly changing and being updated, more rapidly than any single one of us can keep up. That is why you should make sure to keep as many sources of information open to you as possible. 

Lastly, The one core belief around which everything else here exists is that:

**THERE IS NO POINT IN MAKING THINGS COMPLEX IN THE PURSUIT OF SOUNDING IMPRESSIVE.**

With all that out of the way, let's get to business. So sit back, put your thinking cap on and let's begin!

## An Introduction: Okay so 'Corona' refers to an aura, but what's the 'Virus' all about?

**Everyone wants to party but nobody wants to do the dishes.**

Before we can get to the interesting stuff about the Coronavirus and COVID-19, the associated disease, it's a good idea to get a relatively good grip of the basics. Before we get to the 'Corona' bit, we will talk a little about the 'Virus' bit. 

### If you are feeling that this is something you don't, won't or can't understand, you're not alone. I know the feeling. Give it five more minutes.

To understand the enemy in all its gory depth, we first have to get an image in our minds of what a virus actually is. Viruses are a huge topic, there are over 5,000 species of them! They have a whole academic field in their own right, that's Virology. 

But don't worry, we won't spend all day here! We only need a very tiny bit of it here.

Viruses are tricky business. It might come as a surprise to you that, in spite of being the most populous type of biological entity, viruses are considered to be neither alive nor dead! This is because viruses by themselves, that is to say, without a host, cannot replicate ( *grow* ), nor can they derive their own energy ( *eat food* ). 

To make things clear, the larger consensus among the scientific community is to not treat viruses as living organisms, though their status has historically always been a matter of debate. This might seem confusing (It is).

### Viruses rely on a host for their growth and nourishment. They show what is called 'host specificity'. This means that all viruses do not affect all organisms. This is an important point that we will use later.

![Virus_Search]({{site.baseurl}}/images/virus_searching_problems.png)

Once they breach into a host cell, that is when they show all the habits you would expect from living beings: 

### A. They can create more copies of themselves ( this is really all there is to biology :) ) 

### B. Package their copies for redistribution ( send the children to work ), as well as derive energy from the host to keep replicating ( see the point ? ).

They use the host's resources to perform their everyday tasks, thereby weakening the host. If this goes on too much for too long and the body, the immune system in particular, starts to fight back in an attempt to remove the virus, the host falls sick (Happens to us all.).

It might have probably occured to you that viruses are like parasites in nature. You wouldn't be wrong!

The basic parts of a virus are simple to understand.

As an aside, when the virus is capable of, but not busy infecting a cell, roaming about in the world, it is called a *virion* : an unemployed virus. 

### There's a very tiny bit of technical terms coming up. Again, if you do not know what they mean, please don't let that discourage you. We'll take apart each one of them and you'll see that just like most things in life, they aren't that complex after all.

With that being said, take a look at this bad boy.

![Virus Diagram]({{site.baseurl}}/images/virus-01.png)

Technically, this picture is that of an 'Animal Virus', the kind of virus that affects you and me. A more mainstream picture will make an appearance further down. 

As you can see, there's really only three parts:

1. The DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) / RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) - **The Mastermind**

2. The Protein Coat - **The Muscle**

3. The Envelope - **The Street Smarts**

### 1. The DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) / RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)  of the Virus

See that white thread in the middle? You would not be very far from the truth if you said that threads like this one are the reason you're forced to sit in your home right now. That's the genetic material of the virus.

That material, which is either DNA or RNA (the distinction is **NOT** important to us right now), is the 'brain' of the virus and decides how the virus will function, that is, how it will create more copies of itself, use energy of the host, and infect the host. 

The name of the game is to synthesize (create) proteins. Proteins are sources of energy that let the virus live and do it's job. More copies of the virus mean more quantity of that protein, more protein leads to more viruses, which means more infection.

### 2. The Protein Coat

That necklace made up of beads is the protein coat. These beads are called 'capsomeres' in technical jargon. Capsomeres are structures filled with protein, they come in different shapes and sizes.

What does that do? 

Well, it got hired by our beloved management at Virus Incorporated for three main reasons:

### A. The coat protects the DNA / RNA of the virus. Similar to how the skull protects the brain.

### B. It has slots that allow the virus to latch on to a host. Think of an infected USB thumb drive that's inserted into a healthy computer through the USB port.

### C. It contains chemicals (proteins) that let the virion (remember the unemployed virus?) sneak into the host (in technical jargon: these proteins help the virion penetrate the host's cell membrane. But that's boring.).

### 3. The Envelope

This outline, the envelope, contains materials (called Glycoproteins, they're a special kind of protein) from the virus as well as the host (if the virus has come in contact with a host).

These materials give the virus the ability to evade the immune system of the host. The immune system works on memory. It can fend off pathogens (disease causing microorganisms) it has seen before. 

By having materials from the immune system of the host, the virus is able to dodge any punches the immune system of the host might throw. 

Thus, showing signs of having some 'memory' of the immune system off of which it is working (this is much like playing a reverse card in UNO).  

Not all viruses in existence have this Envelope. For those that don't, the glycoproteins just mentioned above are present on the capsid ( Protein Coat ).

### One for the 'Gram: Feel Free To Give This One No Likes

Oh and about that Mainstream virus image? 

Here it is, this is a type of virus that's called a *Bacteriophage*. They are viruses that specifically infect bacteria. **Impressive in their own right, but not of much use to us right now.**

### We need just one more bite from the basics cake before we're ready to move to the interesting questions!

## Viral Infections: Hmm... I'm Still Listening, But How Has This Little Thing Managed To Lock Me Up?

This is the last bit that remains for us to explore after which we're armed with all the tools needed to understand the all the "Whys" of the Coronavirus. Those are the only questions worth asking. Let's repeat one thing that showed up before:

### There's going to be some technical terms coming up. A little more than the ones that showed up above. They are going to be relevant. Not just for these posts, but for your understanding. As above, we'll rip everything down to it's simplest core.

The one thing that remains to be talked about is: 

### How Do Viruses Infect Hosts?

Answering this well has two benefits:

### 1. We can understand and make decisions on the Coronavirus and any future pandemic that may arise.

### 2. We'll be able to do better at Plauge, Inc.

An infection by a virus, right from the point of finding a host, to the point of either killing the host, or leaving it to create more copies of itself while the host dies slowly, involves majorly six steps. 

These differ in some details based on the virus. But the fundamentals remain the same. Let's dive in!

### STEP 1: Finding The Perfect Match (Attachment)

To spare you the pain of scrolling back up, let's bring back an image we saw earlier. 

![Virus Diagram]({{site.baseurl}}/images/virus-01.png)

It all starts with finding that perfect match. See the Viral Envelope? It holds glycoproteins inside that allow the virus to attach to the cell membrane of the host.

Remember the 'host specificity' of a virus we talked about ? This comes into play right now. The host must have the correct kind of receptors for the virus to be able to infect it and even in those receptors, the virus can infect only certain cells. 

What does that mean ? Well, think of it like this: You can't just put a USB cable into an AUX port (An AUX port is basically your 'headphone jack'. It's a tragedy those are disappearing.). 

Even with USB, there are different types of USB ports (Type-C, Micro USB, USB 2.0, USB 3.0, even USB 1.1, you get the idea).

![Virus_Fitting]({{site.baseurl}}/images/virus_fitting_problems.png)

These 'ports' are present on what's called the cell membrane (the outer layer of the cell, much like the outer covering of an onion. Thinking about the outer covering of your mobile phone, that houses all the ports, is also an okay visualization) of the host. 

The Glycoproteins on the Viral Envelope of the Virus interact with these receptors and this is the part that decides whether the Virus will affect this particular Host or not.

![Virus_Fitting]({{site.baseurl}}/images/virus_attack_1.png)

In very much the same way, the host has to have the correct kind of 'ports' on it's surface for the virus to be able to 'fit in'. In jargon, this is called the 'host range' of the Virus.

### STEP 2: The Virus Penetrates The Host (Viral Penetration)

In general, when the Virus and the Host are attached, the Host 'eats' the Virus. What does this mean ? Well, the cell membrane of the Host surrounds the Virus and engulfs it in. At this point, the Virus gets access to the Host.

![Virus_Fitting]({{site.baseurl}}/images/virus_attack_2.png)

In jargon, this process is called 'endocytosis'. However, like in the image, some Viruses have an Envelope. What about them ?

Well for them, when the Virus and the host are attached, the Envelope of the Virus and the cell membrane of the Host fuse together. It is at this point that the virus gains access to the host. 

### STEP 3: The Protein Coat Comes Off (Uncoating)

After the Envelope has come off and once the Virus is inside, the capsid (the protein coat) is discarded and the Viral Genetic Material is released inside the host cell.

![Virus_Fitting]({{site.baseurl}}/images/virus_attack_3.png)

When this happens, the Host really is in trouble.

### STEP 4: Making More Viruses (Viral Replication)

After the Uncoating is complete, it's time for the Virus to make all its efforts count! This is where the Virus starts to make more copies of itself. This is the part where the Host's clock is turned into a countdown. 

At this point, the difference between whether the Genetic Material of the Virus has DNA or RNA becomes significant. We'll look at two cases, 'DNA Viruses' and 'RNA Viruses' based on whether the material is DNA or RNA.

### DNA Viruses

DNA Viruses are less self-reliant than RNA Viruses. DNA Viruses use the proteins and enzymes of the host to create a molecule called mRNA (messenger RNA).

### RNA Viruses

![Virus_Fitting]({{site.baseurl}}/images/virus_attack_4.png)

### STEP 5: Packaging The Newly Made Viruses (Assembly)

At this point, the newly prepared Viral Genome along with Viral Proteins must be assembled to create new Virions that must be prepared for leaving the nest. That is to say, to go on and infect other Hosts. 

For most Viruses with the Viral Envelope, this assembly happens in either the Nucleus or the Cytoplasm (the Cytoplasm is a fluid includes all of the material inside the cell apart from the Nucleus) and their exit occurs through Lysis (explained below).

For Viruses without the Viral Envelope, the case is a little different. Their Virions are packaged as they leave the Host. The Viral Proteins in this case are inserted into the Host's Cell Membrane. 

The Capsids enclosing the Viral Genome (Nucleocapsids) exit through Budding (explained below) from those parts of the Cell Membrane where the Proteins are attached.

Cleavage (removal) and further maturation of the Proteins occurs outside the Host cell.

![Virus_Fitting]({{site.baseurl}}/images/virus_attack_5.png)

### STEP 6: Moving On From The Host (Virion Release / Egress)

This is essentially the stage where the newly created Viruses (for that point they are just sitting there, so we call them Virions) leave the current host. They leave in two ways:

### 1. Lysis

Lysis refers to phenomenon of the rupture of the cell membrane of a cell. In this context, these cells are exactly the ones inside the Host. When you puncture a cell, the contents will eventually 'drain out' and disintegrate. The cell ruptures, thus, dying. 

![Virus_Fitting]({{site.baseurl}}/images/virus_attack_7.png)

These bad boys go by the name of 'Cytolytic Viruses' in literature.

### 2. Budding

Budding is a rather peaceful end to a Viral Infection cycle. Here, the Virions peacefully leave through the cell membrane, while the cell continues to create more Viruses. This method of Virion exit does not kill the Host cell. 

![Virus_Fitting]({{site.baseurl}}/images/virus_attack_6.png)

However, the remaining Virions in the Host cell become targets of the Host's antibodies (Antibodies are the rescue team your immune system sends to fight off pathogens).

Budding is typical of viruses with Envelopes. This is because when the newly created Virus leaves the Host cell, it acquires the Envelope by modifying the Host's Plasma Membrane. An aside, the Plasma Membrane is not the same thing as the Cell Membrane.

The Cell Membrane covers the entire cell, protects the cell from invaders and is open to being used for movement stimulation and feeding. The Plasma Membrane servers neither of these purposes. 

These merciful pests are termed 'Cytopathic Viruses' in technical jargon.

### Infection In Action

Here's all the previous steps put together into a nice GIF:
