## (A Personal) Prologue

This post is a little special. One of the main reasons is that I'm taking to writing after a year, as I managed to burn myself out completely in the past six months.

I am glad for people who take the time out to read and review what I have to say on things I like. This is a big part of what keeps me writing. 

##  Simple Is The New Sexy: Our Approach To Understanding

A lot of the COVID-19 posts tend to live on two extremes. They either become too technical too quickly, or merely enlist a bunch of statistics without any explanation, jump to conclusions and start resembling popular culture magazine articles.

I've tried to maintain a balance by boiling things down to their simplest forms while not being wrong. 

### The aim is to be able to explain the relevant science to anyone, anywhere, regardless of their background.

These are uncertain times, and they require carefully worded and delicately handled explanations. 

That's why this topic has been broken down into a series of posts. I plan to stop at three. This is the first.

In the first post, we want to set the stage so that we're able to answer two major questions about this pandemic. They are: 

### 1. What Is The Coronavirus ?

### 2. How Is It Spreading So Quickly ?

Later, we'll ask the really interesting questions related to the Coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 ( the name COVID-19 is old news :) ). We'll also look at the more *human* aspect of things and talk about what lies ahead in the future for humanity and whether pandemics like this one will become a part of our lives (?!?).  

## The biggest advantage of true understanding is that we'll be able to get all the virology memes!

### The tone of every post in this series, unlike those in the past, is going to be realistic, which is code for informal. I intend to keep the mood light and upbeat with comic images and GIFs, while talking about a very serious topic that is the cause of these uncertain times. 

One point worth mentioning before we begin is that the material on this subject is constantly changing and being updated, more rapidly than any single one of us can keep up. That is why you should make sure to keep as many sources of information open to you as possible. 

Lastly, The one core belief around which everything else here exists is that:

**THERE IS NO POINT IN MAKING THINGS COMPLEX IN THE PURSUIT OF SOUNDING IMPRESSIVE.**

With all that out of the way, let's get to business. So sit back, put your thinking cap on and let's begin!

## An Introduction: Okay so 'Corona' refers to an aura, but what's the 'Virus' all about?

**"Everyone wants to party but nobody wants to do the dishes."**

Before we can get to the interesting stuff about the Coronavirus and COVID-19, the associated disease, it's a good idea to get a relatively good grip of the basics. Before we get to the 'Corona' bit, we will talk a little about the 'Virus' bit. 

### If you already feel like this is something you don't, won't or can't understand, you're not alone. I know the feeling. Give it five more minutes.

To understand the enemy in all its gory depth, we first have to get an image in our minds of what a virus actually is. Viruses are a huge topic, there are over 5,000 species of them! They have a whole academic field in their own right, that's Virology. 

But don't worry, we won't spend all day here! We only need an 'Icing On The Cake' worth of it (it's alright if you did not catch that pun).

Viruses are tricky business. It might come as a surprise to you that, in spite of being the most populous type of biological entity, viruses are considered to be neither alive nor dead! This is because viruses by themselves, that is to say, without a host, cannot replicate ( *grow* ), nor can they derive their own energy ( *eat food* ). 

To make things clear, the larger consensus among the scientific community is to not treat viruses as living organisms, though their status has historically always been a matter of debate. This might seem confusing (It is).

**Viruses rely on a host for their growth and nourishment. They show what is called 'host specificity'. This means that all viruses do not affect all organisms. This is an important point that we will use later.**

Once they breach into a host cell, that is when they show all the habits you would expect from living beings: 

**A. They can create more copies of themselves ( this is really all there is to biology :) )**

**B. Package their copies for redistribution ( send the children to work ), as well as derive energy from the host to keep replicating ( see the point ? ).** 

They use the host's resources to perform their everyday tasks, thereby weakening the host (if this goes on too much for too long, the host falls sick. Happens to us all.).

It might have probably occured to you that viruses are like parasites in nature. You wouldn't be wrong!

The basic parts of a virus are simple to understand.

As an aside, when the virus is capable of, but not busy infecting a cell, roaming about in the world, it is called a *virion*: an unemployed virus. 

### There's a very tiny bit of technical terms coming up. Again, if you do not know what they mean, please don't let that discourage you. We'll take apart each one of them and you'll see that just like most things in life, they aren't that complex after all.

With that being said, a structure is down here.

![Virus Diagram]({{site.baseurl}}/images/virus-01.png)

Technically, this picture is that of an 'Animal Virus', the kind of virus that affects you and me. A more mainstream picture will make an appearance further down. 

As you can see, there's really only three parts:

1. The DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) / RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) - **The Mastermind**

2. The Protein Coat - **The Muscle**

3. The Envelope - **The Street Smarts**

### 1. The DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) / RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)  of the Virus

See that dark thread in the middle? You would not be very far from the truth if you said that threads like this one are the reason you're forced to sit in your home right now. That's the genetic material of the virus.

That material, which is either DNA or RNA (the distinction is **NOT** important to us right now), is the 'brain' of the virus and decides how the virus will function, that is, how it will create more copies of itself, use energy of the host, and infect the host. 

The name of the game is to synthesize (create) proteins. Proteins are sources of energy that let the virus live and do it's job. More copies of the virus mean more quantity of that protein, more protein leads to more viruses, which means more infection.

### 2. The Protein Coat

That necklace made up of beads (they are called 'capsomeres' in technical jargon. capsomeres are structures filled with protein, they come in different shapes and sizes) is the protein coat. 

What does that do? 

Well, it got hired by our beloved management at Virus Incorporated for three main reasons:

**A. The coat protects the DNA / RNA of the virus. Similar to how the skull protects the brain.**

**B. It has slots that allow the virus to latch on to a host. Think of an infected USB thumb drive that's inserted into a healthy computer through the USB port.** 

**C. It contains chemicals (proteins) that let the virion (remember the unemployed virus?) sneak into the host (in technical jargon: these proteins help the virion penetrate the host's cell membrane. But that's boring.)**

### 3. The Envelope

This outline, the envelope, contains materials (called glycoproteins, a special kind of protein) from the virus as well as the host (if the virus has come in contact with a host).

These materials give the virus the ability to evade the immune system of the host. The immune system works on memory. It can fend off pathogens (disease causing microorganisms) it has seen before. 

By having materials from the immune system of the host, the virus is able to dodge any punches the immune system of the host might throw. 

Thus, showing signs of having some 'memory' of the immune system off of which it is working (this is much like playing a reverse card in UNO).  

Not all viruses in existence have this Envelope.

### One for the 'Gram: Feel Free To Give This One No Likes

Oh and about that mainstream virus image? 

Here it is, this is a type of virus that's called a *Bacteriophage*. They are viruses that specifically infect bacteria. **Impressive in their own right, but not of much use to us right now.**

### We need just one more bite from the basics cake before we're ready to move to the interesting questions!

## Viral Infections: Hmm... I'm Still Listening, But How Has This Little Thing Managed To Lock Me Up?

This is the last bit that remains for us to explore after which we're armed with all the tools needed to understand the all the "Why's" of the Coronavirus. Those are the only questions worth asking. Let's repeat one thing that showed up before:

### There's going to be some technical terms coming up. A little more than the ones that showed up above. Just like then, we'll rip everything down to it's simplest core.

The one thing that remains to be talked about is: 

### How Do Viruses Infect Hosts?

Answering this well has two benefits:

### 1. We can understand and make decisions on the Coronavirus and any future pandemic that may arise.

### 2. We'll be able to do better at Plauge, Inc.

An infection by a virus, right from the point of finding a host, to the point of either killing the host, or leaving it to create more copies of itself while the host dies slowly, involves majorly six steps. 

These differ in some details based on the virus. But the fundamentals remain the same. Let's dive in!

It all starts with finding that perfect match. Remember the 'host specificity' of a virus we talked about ? This comes into play right now. The host must have the correct kind of receptors for the virus to be able to infect it and even in those receptors, the virus can infect only certain cells. 

What does that mean ? Well, think of it like this: You can't just put a USB cable into an AUX port (An AUX port is basically your 'headphone jack'. It's a tragedy those are disappearing.). Even with USB, there are different types of USB ports (Type-C, Micro USB, USB 2.0, USB 3.0, even USB 1.1, you get the idea).

These 'ports' are present on what's called the 'cell membrane' (an outer layer of the cell, much like the outer covering of an onion, or the outer covering of your mobile phone, that houses all the ports, if that's more relevant) of the host. 

In very much the same way, the host has to have the correct kind of 'ports' on it's surface for the virus to be able to 'fit in'. 

Once the perfect match has been found, the really fun (excuse my enthusiasm over this horrible thing) part begins! 

### STEP 1: The Virus Attaches Itself To The Host

To spare you the pain of scrolling back up, let's bring back an image we saw earlier. 

[!putImageHere]


See the Viral Envelope? It holds glycoproteins inside that allow the virus to attach to the cell membrane of the host.
